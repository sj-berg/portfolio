### Stephanie Paver RD - Contractor and Advisor

[www.StephaniePaverRD.com](http://www.StephaniePaverRD.com)

I started working with Stephanie Paver to help her improve her small business. I led her in branding exercises and we discussed her model at length. We took into account her taste and her audience to create a new branding guide and eventually niched down into a specialty in PCOS and Pregnancy.

Assets I created: social media posts for IG for 1.5 years, website, handouts, photographs for website and socials, Kajabi course

Using a pre-exisiting logo, I designed a website for the many arms of the Phoenix Swing Project. I went on to create a branding guide for the organization and to create many internal documents and social media posts.
